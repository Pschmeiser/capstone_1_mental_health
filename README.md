Capstone 1: Mental Health in the Tech Industry
### Problem
Over the past 10 years mental health has finally gained more attention and importance in society.  The occurrence of a mental health issues can not only cause major issues in one's personal life but can also disrupt the success of any company.  As we are focused in data science this project chooses to look at those issues specifically in the tech industry.  There are many factors that can cause the occurrence of a mental health issue which need exploration.  This project uses the 2014 data set collected from 1260 persons currently working in the tech industry.  The goal was to explore three different metrics and their relation to the occurrence of a mental health issue.

#### Data
This data set comes from [Open Sourcing Mental Illness, LTD] and is available at (https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey).  An ongoing survey currently exists as well for 2016 which could be used for future projects.  

The dataset did require a large amount of cleaning specifically in the gender column which was one of the metrics explored. This will be further explained in the following section.  

Two other metrics, company size and family history of mental illness, were also explored.  From the initial EDA and plotting two metrics indicated some significance and underwent hypothesis testing.
